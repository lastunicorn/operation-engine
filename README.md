# Operation Engine

This framework offers a simple approach of instantiating and executing Sub Use Cases which are executed from multiple Use Cases.

## I) Usage

### Install NuGet Packages

```powershell
Install-Package DustInTheWind.OperationEngine
Install-Package DustInTheWind.OperationEngine.Extensions.Autofac
```

### Register Operations

This example uses an Autofac container builder.

```csharp
builder.RegisterOperationEngine(config =>
{
    config.AddOperationsFromAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
});
```

### Create an Operation

```csharp
internal class MyOperation : IOperation
{
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public int Age { get; set; }

    public Task ExecuteAsync()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Executing MyOperation. Name: {Name}; Age: {Age}");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

### Execute an Operation

An instance of the `OperationManager` must be injected in the constructor.

Then, it can be used like this:

```csharp
await operationManager.ExecuteAsync<MyOperation>(op =>
{
    op.Name = "Alex";
    op.Age = 20;
});
```

## II) History

### The Need

When implementing Use Cases (Commands and Queries), there will be, eventually, a need to extract and reuse parts of one use case in other use cases.

### The "Simple" Solution

The simplest approach is to extract the shared logic into a new class and use it across all relevant Use Cases:

- Instantiate the class;
- Set its properties;
- Call the `Execute()` method (or a similarly named method)

I call this class an Operation.

### The Problem

One recurring issue I've encountered is that these Operation classes often require dependencies from the Dependency Container. This means the parent class (which instantiates the Operation) must also have those same dependencies injected into its constructor to pass them to the Operation. This creates unnecessary transitive dependencies in the parent class that it doesn't actually useâ€”an undesirable approach.

### The "Complete" Solution

I have decided to create a Manager class that exposes methods for executing Operations. The Manager uses a Factory class to create these Operations. The Factory provides the necessary dependencies to each Operation when it's instantiated, typically using a dependency injection framework such as Autofac, Ninject, or Microsoft Dependency Injection behind the scenes.
